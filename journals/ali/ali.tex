\section{6/14/2019}
for the first log lets go over what I did overall til now.
I looked at "Train your first neural network"
tried doing it on vscode but tensorflow didnt work and in my attempts to fix it by changing python version, 
I somehow managed to totally fuck it up and now I have bigger problems.
I started watching the google machine learning video. Im half way through so Im gonna talk more about that in the next commit ( tomorrow or sunday).
I also started looking at some latex tutorials. it seems to be too much work just to make a pdf file.
I don't like github as much as others but its a major tool so I better get used to it. every single time i go on it it feels like a new experience cuz i forget everything every time.
I feel a little scared and maybe overwhelmed but it be like that sometimes. its just the beginning.
(you will probably find alot of mistakes (grammatical or verbal) in my logs because grammarly does not work on vscode)
