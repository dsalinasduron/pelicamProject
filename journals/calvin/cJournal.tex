\section{\Large \itshape  Entry 1, 6/13/19}
    I looked into Tensorflow today,
\newline
Feels good to be doing what I love and getting pay.
\newline
Meeting is tomorrow we'll see
\newline
How this project shapes up to be.

\section{\Large \itshape  Entry 2, 6/14/19}
    Meet up with Daniel and the gang
\newline
Topology entices me and R is an interesting lang.
\newline
I have a lot of work ahead of me in learning the math and tech,
\newline
But in the end we'll have a pelican recognizer up to spec.
\newline


\section{\Large \itshape  Entry 3, 6/15/19}
    Met with the previous project lad,
\newline
The syntax of tensor code sure looks bad.
\newline
I'm hopeful though seeing all of the possibilities we have ahead,
\newline
I'll try to figure the basics out Saturday before I go to bed.

\section{\Large \itshape  Entry 4, 6/15/19}
    Functors and tensorflow all were learned,
\newline
Extreme learning curve I must say.
\newline
Through the knowledge I have earned,
\newline
I can code with the 'flow with a thought and prayer.

\section{\Large \itshape  Entry 5, 6/17/19}
    Tensorflow and topology were dived into,
\newline
Everything starting to click together.
\newline
My respect for toruses and line theory greatly grew.
\newline
Gaining interest in strange math again altogether.
