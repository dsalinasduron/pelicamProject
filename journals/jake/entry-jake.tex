\section{\Large \itshape  Entry 1, \today}
	Today I did some preliminary research into Tensorflow and general machine learning.
There are a lot of things I need to learn still but it's important that I stay on task and learn the important things.
One question I have is about what language/system I should start diving into, but that information will likely be revealed at tomorrow's meeting.
I am somewhat concerned that this will all go over my head, but I think that's also just part of the process. The math is fairly complicated but there are libraries for things like this I'm sure.
